<!-- Task 8: if sentences in Django
Make this page such that it shows different content depending on the reported age.
Use the django's if sentence and then a mathematical expression for the variable player.age
Then you can use and else sentence for alternative content, in case the condition is not satisfied.
To close the if sentence, use the command endif
