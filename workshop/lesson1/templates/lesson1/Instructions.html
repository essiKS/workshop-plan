    <h3> Trust game </h3>

    <p> You are participating in a trust game. <br>
        Your role is that of the <b>{{ player.role }}</b>. <br>
        You are paired with another player that has the role of
    {% if player.role == "trustor" %}
    trustee
    {% else %}
    trustor
    {% endif %}. </p>

    <p> In the beginning of this game, the trustor receives an endowment of {{ Constants.endowment }} points.
        Then, the trustor must decide how many of these points to send to the trustee.
        Each point sent will then be tripled by the experimenter.</p>

    <p> The trustee then finds out how many points has been sent by the trustor.
        The points are multiplied by the experimenter and out of these points,
        the trustee must decide how many to send back to the trustor. </p>

    <p> After the decisions, the game ends and both players will learn the outcome of the game. </p>
