    This document, also called html template, defines your first webpage.
    (The order of the pages is defined in pages.py python file.)
    Any commands with curly brackets and percentage signs are in Django.
    Html elements are in <> "brackets".
    This document can support also scripts, f.ex. JavaScript.
    Notice that the languages overlap: Django and the html code can do a lot of similar things -
    - Django essentially simplifies html.

    While modifying this document, you can have your otree server running.
    By refreshing the page on your browser (F5), you can see how the website's design changes.

 <!-- Task 2: give a subtitle "Basic html" to the contents using html elements h1-h6,
     and then change the text in p to what ever you want or to the following:

      "Html code is inside the brackets <>. The the different html elements can be
      modified for example in size and colour. <b>Use b elements to create bold text</b>. The <br> element
      stands for a (line) break." -->

    <!-- Task 8: Next button

    You can submit the page by pressing enter, but you can also create a button "next" that submits the page and
    moves the user to the next one. ("Submit" has the special meaning of also saving the data on the database.)

    Add a "next" button with the shorthand Django command next_button, with the curly brackets and % signs.

    If you press the next button or Enter on your keyboard after providing an answer, you will exit this page.
    To return back to this page, you must start a new session in the oTree user interface.

    Notice that age and name are required fields, you cannot exit without providing answers.-->

    <!--Task 9: Custom next button:
    Django and oTree offer a lot of shortcuts for doing things. These shortcuts are however all made out of html code
    and can be made out of scratch or customized. This is useful for example when not using the default language of
    English.

    1. The button below is disabled. You can activate it by removing the disabled attribute.

    2. You can make it into a basic otree button with custom text by adding the class attribute:
        class = "otree-btn-next btn btn-primary next-button otree-next-button"

    3. The button text inside can be customized to whichever language you want it to be in.-->

       <button class = "otree-btn-next btn btn-primary next-button otree-next-button">Successivo</button>
