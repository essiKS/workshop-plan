<!-- Task 11: if sentences in Django
Make this page such that it shows different content depending on the reported age.
Use the django's if sentence and then a mathematical expression for the variable player.age
Then you can use an else-sentence for alternative content, in case the condition is not satisfied.
To close the if sentence, you need the the command endif. -->
